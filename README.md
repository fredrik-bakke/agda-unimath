# ![The agda-unimath library](https://github.com/UniMath/agda-unimath/assets/1252282/cbd9b67e-581c-41c7-bc1e-34862127bad2)

The `agda-unimath` library is a community formalization project for univalent
mathematics in [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda). The library project was
created by Elisabeth Stenholm, Jonathan Prieto-Cubides, and Egbert Rijke, and is
currently being maintained by Egbert Rijke, Fredrik Bakke, and Vojtěch
Štěpančík. Our goal is to formalize an extensive curriculum of mathematics from
the univalent point of view. Furthermore, we think libraries of formalized
mathematics have the potential to be useful, and informative resources for
mathematicians. Our library is designed to work towards this goal, and we
welcome contributions to the library about any topic in mathematics.
